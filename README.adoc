= Accounging-Group Quota management for HTCondor
William Strecker-Kellogg <https://github.com/fubarwrangler>

An HTCondor Account Group manager, used by the US ATLAS Teir-1 at BNL.

== Background
HTCondor Hierarchical Group Quotas are used to partition the pool logically into
queues, with each sub group containing a single species of job. Then the

== Auto-Balancing
Balancing is done by setting the 'accept_surplus' flag on each queue depending
on the load in its neighboring queues and their weight. See
Documentation/balancing-algorithm.adoc for more details.

== Webpage

The webpage under gqweb/ is a flask application that allows users to create,
modify, and remove groups. Different users will have different privileges, from
read-only, to being able to alter the quotas in a subgroup without changing the
parent (EZ-Edit), to changing anything about the group-tree.

=== Editing Groups
Groups can be added / removed as long as they conform to the tree structure
already existing. Once groups are present, their quota, weight, threshold, and
other parameters can be edited.

Changing anything about the groups in the full editor:

=== Balancing Between Groups
An example of the EZ-Editor that allows someone to rebalance among a certain portion
of a tree while keeping the parent group fixed:

You can select any subtree of the groups and balance among them.

=== Users and Roles
Users are authenticated according to your environment, for example we pass a
shibboleth token to the backend with the username, but any other auth can be used.

Users can be given different roles, from full administrator, to read-only.

1. Admin: full rights
2. Alter: can add and remove groups
3. Edit: can edit any parameters about groups
4. Balance: can only use the EZ-Editor, not change the sum of the quotas
