The webpage under gqweb/ is a flask application that allows users to create,
modify, and remove groups. Different users will have different privileges, from
read-only, to being able to alter the quotas in a subgroup without changing the
parent (EZ-Edit), to changing anything about the group-tree.

An example of the EZ-Editor that allows someone to rebalance among a certain portion
of a tree while keeping the parent group fixed:
